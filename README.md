# Archiver

Archiver is a PHP program to manage and display files and folders on a filesystem.

Its has been developped by [Erwan Demay](https://github.com/ErwanDemay) as a part of his internship at ÉSAD Pyrénées, to be used on [Ateliers website](https://ateliers.esad-pyrenees.fr/web/archives/), to store and display students projects.

## What does this program do

- It recursively computes folders weights and stores the values in cache,
- It recursively computes folders last modification dates,
- It warns about empty folders, spaces or weird characters in filenames.

## Update 2026

Heavily rewritten to address performances issues:
- Reduced per-folder filesystem scans 
- Centralized cache path 
- Get freshness by filesystem change, not TTL
- Migrated cache store from JSON to SQLite
