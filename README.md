# Archivals Lister

Here is a program that I created for [ESAD Pyrénées Website](https://ateliers.esad-pyrenees.fr/web/archives/) to manage and display files and folders from the HTPS Server , used to stock students projects and archivals.

I created this as a part of my internship at ESAD 

## ⚙️ What does this programm do 
This PHP  program calculate folders and sub-folders sizes and display it next to each file/folder in the arborescence , so that we can manage if a folder is taking a lot of stockage on the servor.


### 🚀 Next features to add

Stock the folder's size in cache to optimise the performance
Display the upload date and calculate it on a folder by his subfolder most récent file uploaded
Improve the styling
